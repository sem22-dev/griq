## Quick Install

GRIQ requires **Python 3** and **pip**. Choose your preferred installation method:

### Via pip (Recommended)

```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/sem22-dev/griq.git
```

### Via Install Script (Alternative)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://griq.site/install.sh | bash
```

Once installed, create a tunnel with:

```bash
griq http 3000    # Expose localhost:3000
```

This will give you a public URL like:

```
https://[random-subdomain].griq.site
```
